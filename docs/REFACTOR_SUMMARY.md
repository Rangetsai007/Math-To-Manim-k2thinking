## Cost Analysis

### DeepSeek (Old)
- **Per API call**: ~$0.001
- **Per animation**: ~$0.10
- **Monthly (100 animations)**: ~$10

### Claude Sonnet 4.5 (New)
- **Per API call**: ~$0.003
- **Per animation (no cache)**: ~$0.30
- **Per animation (with cache)**: ~$0.15
- **Monthly (100 animations)**: ~$15-30

**Verdict**: 1.5-3x higher cost, but worth it for:
- Superior quality
- Better reasoning
- Native agent framework
- Production-ready infrastructure
